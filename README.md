# Video Calling Site

Welcome to our Video Calling Site! This platform allows users to engage in real-time video calls with friends, family, or colleagues over the internet.

## Overview

Our video calling site leverages cutting-edge technologies to provide a seamless and secure video calling experience. Here's a brief overview of the key features:

- **Socket Communication**: Utilizes sockets for real-time communication between clients and the server, enabling instant data exchange necessary for video streaming.
- **WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication)**: Integrates WebRTC technology for peer-to-peer audio and video communication directly between web browsers, ensuring low-latency and high-quality video calls.
- **Peer-to-Peer Connection**: Establishes peer-to-peer connections between users, allowing them to communicate directly without passing through intermediaries, enhancing privacy and performance.

## How It Works

Our video calling site operates on a client-server model, utilizing WebRTC for peer-to-peer communication. Here's an overview of how it works:

1. **User Registration/Login**: Users can register or log in to the platform using their credentials.
2. **Create or Join a Call**: Users can create a new video call session and invite others by sharing a unique link or join an existing call using the provided link.
3. **Establish Peer-to-Peer Connection**: Upon joining a call, the browser establishes a direct peer-to-peer connection with other participants using WebRTC technology.
4. **Audio/Video Streaming**: Users can enable their audio and video feeds, which are streamed in real-time to other participants in the call.
5. **Interactive Features**: Our platform supports interactive features such as text chat, screen sharing, and virtual backgrounds to enhance the video calling experience.
6. **End Call**: Users can end the call at any time, terminating the peer-to-peer connection and returning to the main interface.

## Technologies Used

Our video calling site utilizes the following technologies:

- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: Frontend development for building the user interface and implementing client-side functionality.
- **Node.js**: Backend development for handling user authentication, managing video call sessions, and facilitating socket communication.
- **Express.js**: Web framework for Node.js used to create a RESTful API for server-client interaction.
- **Socket.IO**: JavaScript library for enabling real-time, bidirectional, and event-based communication between clients and the server.
- **WebRTC**: Open-source project enabling real-time communication between web browsers, facilitating peer-to-peer audio and video communication.
